# Pomodoro App
This project is a **Pomodoro Timer** Application built using Python's **tkinter** and **ttkbootstrap** libraries for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The application helps users manage tasks efficiently by timing work and break periods based on the Pomodoro technique.

## Concept

This is was the basic idea behind this project. I wanted to make a pomodoro timer app which can give us an mock test like experience.

## Usage

1. Launch the executable file.  
2. Click the **"Add New Task"** button to create a new task.  
3. A task will be created with a default timer set to **15 minutes**.  
4. Customize your task by:  
   - Adding a **name** for the task.  
   - Setting a **custom timer** (in minutes).  
   - Attaching a **PDF file** for reference (optional).  
5. Once your task details are set, click the **"Start"** button to begin the timer.  
6. When the timer runs out:  
   - A popup will alert you that the time has expired.  
   - A **Word document** will automatically open, containing the task number and name, allowing you to document your progress or mock test results.
